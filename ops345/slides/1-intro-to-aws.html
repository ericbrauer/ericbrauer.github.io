<section id="at-this-point" class="slide level1">
<h1>At This Point…</h1>
<p>…You should have some sort of Linux platform working and ready to go.
You should have a terminal, and be able to run SSH commands.</p>
<p>The rest of our VMs will be hosted <em>in the Cloud</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="just-what-is-the-cloud" class="slide level1">
<h1>Just What Is The Cloud?</h1>
<p>A: Somebody else’s computer. Or rather, somebody else’s extensive
arrangement of computing power.</p>
<p>Most businesses are moving from <em>onsite solutions</em> (ie. having
their own servers and infrastructure) to solutions like AWS (where
Amazon provides them everything). Why?</p>
</section>
<section id="history-lesson" class="slide level1">
<h1>History Lesson</h1>
<p>When companies first moved into online spaces, they most likely
setting up their own web servers, email servers and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your website was static, it probably just pointed to your telephone
number maybe a list of stock or services.</li>
<li>Your web traffic was in the <em>hundreds</em> (if that!)</li>
<li>One machine (and one employee) might be sufficient!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="history-lesson-1" class="slide level1">
<h1>History Lesson</h1>
<ul>
<li>Pets Versus Livestock.</li>
<li>This solution doesn’t <em>scale</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="supply-versus-demand" class="slide level1">
<h1>Supply Versus Demand</h1>
<ul>
<li>The majority of our traffic arrives at peak times (daylight
hours).</li>
<li>Customers have high expectations of <em>availability</em> for our
services. 99.99% uptime.</li>
<li>A computer uses power as long as it is running, whether it is doing
anything or not. If it’s <em>one</em> machine, this doesn’t matter so
much, but what about 10,000?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-issue" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Issue</h1>
<p>You need computing resources to accommodate peak demand, but don’t
want to waste resources when demand eases. So essentially we want our
supply of computing to be as flexible as our requirements.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-solution-from-a-managers-perspective"
class="slide level1">
<h1>The Solution (From A Manager’s Perspective)</h1>
<p>Why maintain our own hardware and infrastructure when we can just put
it in the Cloud and pay Amazon per minute? (The same way we pay for
electricity)</p>
</section>
<section id="the-solution-from-our-perspective" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Solution (From Our Perspective)</h1>
<ul>
<li>‘Virtualise’ our hardware so that one configuration can be cloned as
many times as needed.</li>
<li>Create ‘instances’ of these virtual machines as needed.</li>
<li>Use ‘load balancing’ to expand/reduce our instances as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the logic that has driven migration to the Cloud. The
disadvantage is that you are now dependent on the Cloud provider, and
trust that they won’t hike their rates, or otherwise leverage their
platform.</p>
</section>
<section id="anyway-enough-of-that" class="slide level1">
<h1>Anyway, Enough Of That</h1>
<p>You have been signed up for <strong>AWS Academy Learner Lab
Foundational Course</strong>. Amazon has envisioned this as a
preliminary course to prepare you for one of <em>its</em> exams, but
we’re going to use it for this course. (Just in case you were wondering
what the other modules and instructions were about).</p>
</section>
<section id="important" class="slide level1">
<h1>Important!</h1>
<p><strong>⚠Use The Link I Provide You To Log In To AWS⚠</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use your account from another course</li>
<li>Don’t enter your credit card information</li>
<li>Make sure the email address associated with your account is your
Myseneca account.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I cannot help you with Billing Problems.</em> You shouldn’t need
to pay AWS any money to complete this course, and you won’t if you pay
attention and follow instructions.</p>
</section>
<section id="starting-the-lab" class="slide level1">
<h1>Starting The Lab</h1>
<p>Once you’ve been invited to the course and created an account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Start Lab</em> to spin up the EC2 Dashboard.</li>
<li>Click <em>AWS</em> when the light is green.</li>
<li>Search for <em>EC2</em> to find the Dashboard that we will use.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="incurring-costs" class="slide level1">
<h1>Incurring Costs</h1>
<ul>
<li>You get $100 of free AWS credit. Should be more than enough for the
course.</li>
<li>Running instances will cost money, depending on their state.</li>
<li>Idle instances won’t incur much, but it’s always better to power
down your instances when you’re finished with them.</li>
<li>After <strong>4 hours</strong> your instances will be turned off for
you.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="security" class="slide level1">
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Unlike OPS245, our instances are on the Internet. <strong>You are
swimming in the Ocean, no longer in a little pond.</strong> Keep that in
mind! Our approach to security is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create our instances inside of a <em>security group</em>, with only
SSH allowed as an inbound connection.</li>
<li>Create a non-default user account, and delete the
<code>ec2-user</code> account.</li>
<li>Use public/private keypair to log in. <strong>No
passwords!</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="security-1" class="slide level1">
<h1>Security</h1>
<ul>
<li>In OPS245, you generated a keypair, and then copied your public key
to a remote machine.</li>
<li>In this course, Amazon will generate a keypair, and you will
download the <strong>private</strong> key to your local machine.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: your private key won’t work if its
permissions are too relaxed. <strong>Your key should only be readable by
your user, and all other permissions should be turned off.</strong></li>
<li>You <em>can</em> transfer your key to other machines, just make sure
that permissions are set correctly. (Hint: use 400)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="security-groups" class="slide level1">
<h1>Security Groups</h1>
<ul>
<li>In OPS245, we would create a virtual machine, then modify
<code>iptables</code> inside that VM to only allow certain types of
traffic.</li>
<li>In AWS, you can think of a Security Groups in the same way. It is a
way of applying similar rules externally.</li>
<li>Another analogy: this allows us to ‘fence off’ certain instances so
that they aren’t reachable to outside entities.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="our-first-security-group" class="slide level1">
<h1>Our First Security Group</h1>
<ul>
<li>The only change you are making is to allow <em>Inbound SSH
connections</em>. Provide a rule name and a description.</li>
<li>Scroll down to find the ‘Save Changes’ button. Your change will be
rejected! Check which boxes require an input.</li>
<li>The instructions specify that SSH should be ‘open to the world’.
(This helps if you are accessing your instances from both the lab and
then at home!) What CIDR would cover that?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="your-first-cloud-based-vm" class="slide level1">
<h1>Your First (Cloud-Based) VM</h1>
<ul>
<li>You’ll notice that we don’t force you to go through the process of
installing an Operating System on one of our AWS instances.</li>
<li>Instead, we are choosing an <em>AMI</em> called ‘Amazon Linux’. This
is pre-built virtual machine which we can then begin tweaking.</li>
<li><em>AMI</em>: Amazon Machine Image. Essentially a VM template. In
the real world a business would be creating their own AMI.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="modifying-virtual-hardware" class="slide level1">
<h1>Modifying Virtual Hardware</h1>
<p>…costs money. Choosing a different type of AMI costs money. We are in
the ‘Free’ tier essentially!</p>
</section>
<section id="configuring-the-instance" class="slide level1">
<h1>Configuring the Instance</h1>
<p>Make sure you are using your security group and keypair for this new
instance! Click ‘Network’ -&gt; ‘Edit’ to modify these settings. The
instructions make it seem like there’s another screen where you change
these, <strong>that’s not the case.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="logging-into-the-instance" class="slide level1">
<h1>Logging Into the Instance</h1>
<ul>
<li>Once your instance is ‘running’, check the dashboard for its
<em>Public IP</em>.</li>
<li>Use your terminal (not the browser!). Specify the <em>private key’s
location</em> in your SSH command.</li>
<li>Use the user account <code>ec2-user</code> and the public IP.</li>
<li>If anything is failing here, first thing to check: your Security
Group settings.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="modifying-your-instance" class="slide level1">
<h1>Modifying Your Instance</h1>
<ul>
<li>Delete the <code>ec2-user</code> account and replace it with your
myseneca username.</li>
<li>Make the hostname persistent.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions carefully to perform the relevant
tasks.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="finishing-the-lab" class="slide level1">
<h1>Finishing the Lab</h1>
<p>As always, I recommend that you power down your instance using the
<code>shutdown</code> command, and click on “End Lab” when you’re
finished.</p>
