<section id="promotion-requirements" class="slide level1">
<h1>Promotion Requirements</h1>
<p>You must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve a weighted average of 50% or better on the two tests
(midterm and final).</li>
<li>Satisfactory complete all <em>assignments</em>. Not Labs!</li>
<li>Achieve a grade of 50% or better on the overall course.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="class-format" class="slide level1">
<h1>Class Format</h1>
<p>In your schedule, you will see 2 classes of 2 hours each. Normally,
we would have 1 lab period and 1 lecture period. Our lectures will be
video lectures, available over Zoom. The second scheduled class will be
our tutorial. This will have more examples, walkthroughs, and I will be
online during that time for questions, help and support, etc. I will
record lectures for those who miss the scheduled classes.</p>
</section>
<section id="tutorial" class="slide level1">
<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<p>It’s a good time to be working on labs and assignments. I will
present examples/walkthroughs, and practice questions that will aid you
in understanding lab/assignment concepts. Afterwards will be lab time.
If you are working on labs during this time, you can get help from me
very quickly.</p>
</section>
<section id="online-lectures" class="slide level1">
<h1>Online Lectures</h1>
<p>The objective of online video lectures is to accommodate people who
may be taking the course in different time-zones. Videos give students
the most flexibility while still delivering the same content. The video
lectures will cover concepts from the lab in a more comprehensive
format. (That is, we take a look at the overall concept rather than
rehashing individual bits of code). Prepare for the class by
reading/reviewing assigned readings, which include text, lab
instruction, and slides before class.</p>
</section>
<section id="assigned-readings" class="slide level1">
<h1>Assigned Readings</h1>
<p>There are two books for this course:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Think Python
2nd Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring
Stuff with Python</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Electronic copies of both can be accessed on Blackboard and available
online as well.</p>
<p>Check the weekly schedule to find out the chapters from each book as
assigned reading. Reading those chapters before each week’s lecture will
help you understand the lectures and to complete the labs.</p>
</section>
<section id="lab-environment-setup" class="slide level1">
<h1>Lab Environment Setup</h1>
<ul>
<li>Requirement for the course: a Linux development environment with git
and Python 3.11.</li>
<li>I recommend creating a VM where you can install a code editor like
VS Code.</li>
<li>Instructions can be found on the Wiki.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="github-setup" class="slide level1">
<h1>GitHub Setup</h1>
<ul>
<li>Create a GitHub account</li>
<li>Generate a public/private keypair for <em>each computer</em> you
will use for labs</li>
<li>Copy your public key and paste it into your GitHub:</li>
<li>Click on profile -&gt; Settings -&gt; GPG &amp; SSH Keys</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lab-submission" class="slide level1">
<h1>Lab Submission</h1>
<ul>
<li>Click on the lab from Blackboard, and accept it.</li>
<li>Clone the repository to your computer using SSH:</li>
<li>Copy to your clipboard</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lab-submission-1" class="slide level1">
<h1>Lab Submission</h1>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>git clone</code> from your terminal and paste the link
from GitHub.</li>
<li>Follow Wiki instructions to create your files.</li>
<li>Run the Lab Check script for each lab to make sure that you complete
all the required tasks.</li>
<li>Labs are submitted on GitHub. Follow instructions to push your code
back into the repository.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="practical-quizzes" class="slide level1">
<h1>Practical Quizzes</h1>
<ul>
<li>The labs will also prepare you for the practical quizzes. These
quizzes can be considered “open book.” You may use class notes, and the
Python interpreter.</li>
<li>However sharing answers is not permitted.</li>
<li>Quizzes will be done online on GitHub Codespaces.</li>
<li>Two types of questions may appear in each quizzes:
<ul>
<li>Coding Questions: You will be asked to write or debug and fix a
script based on given details. You are allowed to use your VM to work
out the answer to this type of questions.</li>
<li>Decoding Questions: You will be given a piece of Python code and you
have to figure out what it does. You will be asked a few questions to
test your understanding of the given piece of Python code. For example:
if you run the python code with a command line argument “ABCD”, what
will be the expected output?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The exact date for each quizzes will be announced at least one week
before the scheduled date.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="assignments" class="slide level1">
<h1>Assignments</h1>
<ul>
<li>Assignments are based off concepts and lessons learned from the
lectures, the labs, and the weekly assigned reading.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask your professor if you have any questions
about the assignments.</li>
<li>There are two mandatory assignments, 15% each.</li>
<li>Files will be provided over GitHub, and GitHub will be used for
evaluation.</li>
<li>Assignments must use code that is <em>within scope for the course
material</em>. Code that is outside the scope of what you learned will
be given a grade of zero.</li>
<li>I may ask you to undergo a code review. If you fail (or fail to
attend) code review, you will only be able to score a maximum of
50%.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="creating-backups" class="slide level1">
<h1>Creating Backups!</h1>

<section id="regarding-llms" class="slide level1">
<h1>Regarding LLMs</h1>
<ul>
<li>LLMs are a fine resource for <em>experienced devs</em>, because we
can evaluate and troubleshoot the solutions that ChatGPT provides.</li>
<li>Before you can evaluate and troubleshoot these solutions, you need
to practice solving easier problems.</li>
<li>This course provides you with this practice, but the problems we
train you on are easily solved with LLMs. In my experience, practice
problems are the <em>only</em> types of problems that LLMs excel at.
(Real life is messy).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="and-so" class="slide level1">
<h1>And So</h1>
<p>I will ask that you <em>not use</em> ChatGPT or similar LLMs during
the course. Try to solve the problems with your debugger and brain.
<strong>The process is the point!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLM solutions are ineligible for points in the assignments and
tests. You <em>will</em> get zero.</li>
<li>Code that is out of scope will be given a grade of zero.</li>
<li>LLMs are not permitted in technical job interviews. If you can’t do
it honestly, you <em>will</em> lose opportunities.</li>
<li>Sharing proprietary code with ChatGPT <em><a
href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-bans-chatgpt-use-after-employee-leak">will
get you fired</a></em>.</li>
<li>Relying on ChatGPT means you will always be reliant on it, <a
