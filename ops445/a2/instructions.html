<h1 id="assignment-2-for-fall-2024">Assignment 2 For Fall 2024</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This will be a group assignment. You will be working in a group of 4
- 5 students. Every student will need to contribute code to their
assignment.</p>
<p>You are asked to <strong>choose a task</strong> for this assignment.
Consider the topics you have learned during your college career. What
topics could be completed using a Python script? What are some common
jobs you might expect to do on a Linux machine running in the
workplace?</p>
<p>Consider some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data backups and restore</li>
<li>System monitoring and alerts</li>
<li>System reports and metrics</li>
<li>Diagnostics and health</li>
<li>Automated system configuration</li>
<li>Network configuration and subnetting</li>
<li>User reports and management</li>
<li>Security auditing</li>
</ul>
<p>Other options are possible. Bring your ideas to the first meeting for
approval.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your assignment should be contained in one or more .py files, but
should be executed from a file called <code>assignment2.py</code>.</li>
<li>You can import any modules from the Python standard library, but
third-party modules are not permitted.</li>
<li>Your assignment must be able to run on either
<strong>Matrix</strong> or the <strong>MyVMLab</strong> instance
provided. You will demonstrate the usage of your assignment on either of
those two machines.</li>
<li>All the code and required files will be inside your repository. You
should clone your repo onto the Linux you are using to demonstrate your
assignment, and I should be able to run <code>git log</code> to see the
commits you’ve made.</li>
<li>Any additional configuration needed to get your assignment working
(ie. you need to make changes to system configuration files) must be
documented and included in your repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>This assignment will take some time to complete. Be sure to start
early and identify obstacles as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3 id="initial-meetup">Initial Meetup</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will be assigned to a group. Meet with your group members, and
arrange methods of communication (email, Teams, etc.)</li>
<li>You will be given a group repository for your work. Verify that all
members have permission to clone the repository.</li>
<li>Begin discussing a topic for your assignment. <strong>It is strongly
recommended you have 2-3 ideas</strong> in case your first choice isn’t
suitable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="milestone-1-topic-approval">Milestone 1: Topic Approval</h3>
<p>We will begin approval meetings one week after deployment. These will
be done either online or in-person, and it is expected that <strong>all
group members are attending and ready to contribute</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide your 2 - 3 topic ideas</li>
<li>Be prepared to answer some questions:
<ul>
<li>How will your program gather required input?</li>
<li>How will your program accomplish its requirements?</li>
<li>How will output be presented?</li>
<li>What arguments or options will be included?</li>
<li>What aspects of development do you think will present the most
challenge?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This meeting will be a dialogue, since there might be some changes or
suggestions that come up during our initial meeting. Once you have
gotten approval for your script, <strong>include the description,
overview and summary of the above questions</strong> inside your
repository’s <code>README.md</code> file.</p>
<p>If your group misses the deadline for milestone 1, you will be given
a zero and will still have to submit a proposal. <strong>Book your
meeting early to avoid disappointment!</strong></p>
<h3 id="completing-the-assignment">Completing the Assignment</h3>
<p>Once approved, you should start making commits to your group
repository. You can work on your code from any computer, but remember
that as a final step, you will need to <strong>demonstrate</strong> your
assignment working correctly on either <strong>Matrix</strong> or
<strong>MyVMLab</strong>.</p>
<p>Also remember that you will need to <strong>explain your
code</strong>. Code that comes from external resources will penalize the
entire group.</p>
<p>There is an additional restrction: <strong>Don’t push to the main
branch</strong>. This is a common restriction in the workplace, where
the main branch is protected.</p>
<p>Finally, you will use a new feature to define the final version of
your code: tag your commit ‘final’ when you have completed the
assignment.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-branches">Setting Up Branches</h4>
<ul>
<li>From GitHub, it is recommended that you create a branch for each
member of your group. Click the ‘main’ drop-down and select ‘Create a
new branch’. Enter your name, or a label for the feature you are working
on.</li>
<li>From your local computer, run <code>git clone</code> to clone your
repo.</li>
<li>Now you will need to checkout your specific branch in order to
commit. Run <code>git checkout &lt;name of branch&gt;</code></li>
<li>You will now be able to commit and push to that branch.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h4>
<p>When group members finish a feature that will become part of the
assignment, they will need to open a <em>pull request</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>From GitHub, select the ‘main’ branch. You will see a message that
your branch is ‘X commits ahead of main’ and an option to ‘Open a Pull
Request’. Click that.</li>
<li>Describe your changes. You will now need 3 members of the group to
approve your pull request.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="adding-the-final-tag">Adding The Final Tag</h4>
<p>This should be your final step, once you have completed your work,
approved all pull requests, and your ‘main’ branch now contains all
required code and documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>From GitHub, find the section called ‘Releases’ inside the right
panel.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Create A New Release’.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Choose a tag’ and create a new tag called ‘v1.0’. Make
sure that branch is set to ‘main’.</li>
<li>Complete the form to give the release a title of ‘Final’ and add a
description of what’s working and what isn’t.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Publish Release’.</li>
<li>Use this version of the code for your demonstration. From your
demonstration machine, do a <code>git pull</code> command. Use
<code>git log</code> to verify that you have checked out the main
branch, and that the tag for the most recent commit is ‘v1.0’.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be verifying this when it’s time to demonstrate your
assignment.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-2-assignment-demonstration">Milestone 2: Assignment
Demonstration</h3>
<p>On the day of your demonstration, again <strong>all group members are
expected to attend</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The assignment should be running on either Matrix or MyVMLab.</li>
<li>Students can demonstrate what the assignment does, and why it’s
useful.</li>
<li>Demonstrate additional options and arguments. Please also note what
configuration changes were needed (if any)</li>
<li>Use <code>git status</code> and <code>git log</code> in the
repository directory.</li>
<li>I will ask you specific questions about how your code works. If you
wrote the code, you will be required to explain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-submission">Final Submission</h3>
<p>Once the demonstration has completed, you will be done. There is an
additional <strong>Post-Mortem</strong> due on Blackboard. These forms
are <strong>individual</strong> each student must write their own.</p>
