# ULI101 - Introduction to Unix/Linux and the Internet #

---

# Course Intro 

Use Blackboard:

- Use Course Information to find out about Promotion Requirements
  <!--Important: Assessments, promotion requirements! -->
- Announcements: Quizzes, Tests and **Crucial Information** will be posted here
- Grades
- Course Documents

---

# Local ULI101 Website

[https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/)

This is where lecture notes will be posted.

- My Schedule, Useful Links, Links to Videos

# General ULI101 Website

[https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~uli101/](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~uli101)

Good resource if you want a second perspective on what we discuss in class.

---

# Other Resources

- Textbook
- Study Group (Very helpful!)
- Most important resource is your own _practice_.

---

# Course Policies

- **Attendance**: I won't be taking attendance, except for quizzes/tests. Learn in whatever way you wish, but if you are missing/failing quizzes, be ready to change your approach. 
- **Lateness**: Please be late quietly, or not at all.
- **Tests/Quizzes**: I will announce on Blackboard/in class/Email at least a week in advance. If you miss an assessment, you get a zero. If you have a doctor's note, you need to tell me **before** the assessment.
- **Academic Dishonesty**: Zero tolerance. I expect you to know the difference. 
- If you have an issue, be prepared to communicate the **specific issue**, including:
    -  error output.
    - what you have tried already.
    - the output of `history` (which we will learn about soon).

---

# Course Policies II

- **Assignments** are a big part of this course, and they must be _completed_ in order to pass. 
- You will need to log on to our servers in order to work on these assignments.
- The assignments don't exist locally, you must have an internet connection to access the servers.- But your progress will be saved automatically as we go.
- **Most importantly, learn by doing.** Practice what you learn in the
  assignments.

# Steps to log into Matrix from the Lab

[See the ULI101 Website](https://cs.senecac.on.ca/~fac/uli101/live/notes/MatrixLoginInformation.pdf)

1. Use SSH Secure Shell
2. Launch, then press _Quick Connect_.
3. Enter `matrix.senecacollege.ca` for the host, and the username you use to log onto Blackboard. **(Must be lowercase!)**
4. If it asks if you want to add to local database, say 'Yes.'
5. Enter your Blackboard password.
6. If all is well, you should see a prompt that looks like this: 

`[eric.brauer@mtrx-node04pd ~]$`

# So What is Linux, and why should you care?

## Time for a History Lesson...

- Unix was developed in 1969, and was meant to run on _mainframes_.
- Unix was widely adopted by businesses but also academic institutions.
- Many people were comfortable with Unix, but it was _proprietary_, meaning it wasn't free to copy, use or modify. 
- Richard Stallman started the GNU project in 1983, hoping to build a Unix-like operating system.
- Linux Torvalds contributed the _kernel_ in 1991. So have that name 'Linux', but keep in mind that there were many contributors to the project.

[Here is a short video about the history of Linux](https://youtu.be/5ocq6_3-nEw)

---

# Why do we care about an operating system from the sixties?

## Because Linux is _everywhere_...

- Supercomputers
- Majority of Servers and Network Infrastructure
- Embedded computers (Think: Raspberry Pi, Cars, Kiosks, ATMs, etc.)
- Smartphones (until Fuchsia replaces Android!)
- Sometimes even on desktops. (~2%!)

# What Does the History of Linux Have to do with Course?

## The way it is organized is different. 

- Assumes multiple users
- Better permission controls
- There's a pattern of having multiple _terminals_ active at any one time

---

# Some Terminology

![A Terminal](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iFRfo.jpg)

Terminal
:	Text input/output environment

Terminal Emulator
:	An application which simulates one of these old devices

Shell
:	Command line interpreter. The shell we will be using is called **Bash**.

SSH
:	A _secure_ protocol that allows us to log into a machine remotely
---
 
# This course is mostly about getting more comfortable with the Shell.

- CLI = Command Line Interface. CLIs are not unique to Linux. Powershell in Windows, Bash on Mac.
- Being able to use a CLI is a crucial skill for programmers for a number of reasons:
	- It's faster
	- A number of commands can be put into a script and can then be run automatically
	- Many servers or embedded systems won't even have a graphical environment installed, or it might be broken. A CLI could be your last resort
	- Many tools for developers are designed to be used from a CLI (for example, Git and NPM).
	- CLIs are much easier to set up for remote work
	- If you've ever had to try and help someone solve a problem remotely on their computer, you know how slow and awkward using a GUI can be. ("Click on the Start Button. No, the other Start Button. What do you see?") Using a GUI is like playing 20 questions. A CLI is all about communicating _directly_ with the system. You need to know the language, but once you do you can get what you want much faster.
	- CLIs are more fun :D

# What is Linux? 
## Linux is _actually_ a Kernel.

Call it Linux, or GNU/Linux, probably at this point it isn't too interesting to you. Just be aware that in some corners of the Internet, the terminology is important.

---

# What is a Kernel? 

![A diagram of a Kernel](https://blog.digilentinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1280px-Kernel_Layout.svg_-600x474.png)

<!--Answer with questions: 

- What is meant by devices?
- Keyboard, OK. How does a keyboard work? More basic, more basic.

- OK, if you really want to know, you can go find out. But really, you press A, you see A. Right?
- Another question: How many programs can your computer run at a time? Open Firefox, calculator, notepad, discord, etc. etc.
- How many cores on your CPU? How many instructions do you think your core can run at a time?
- When you have too many things open at a time, your computer 'slows down.' What does that really mean?
- How fast does a core run? GigaHertz? Do you think that speed (3.8 GHz) is slowing down?
- Finally: memory. In your C class, you're going to talk about pointers, memory addressing, all that kind of stuff. Store a number in memory. Look for it. How does the computer know where to look?-->

# Kernel Summary

- _The Kernel is a thing that acts as an interface between applications and hardware._
- _You can't directly interact with it. It's not quite the Operating System._
- _Maybe a good analogy is an air traffic controller. You don't see the effect is you're a passenger at the airport, watching the planes. It doesn't affect your user experience at all._
- _Linux has many desktop environments. But they all use the same Kernel._ (Windows, by comparison, has only one Desktop environment. It's running on the Windows NT kernel, but we never really talk about the Windows kernel.)

- [Feel free to geek out over the specifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_operating_system_kernels)

## Commands Are What We _Really_ Want You To Learn!

Once you are in Matrix/Knoppix, you can practice the following commands:

- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls`: List files
- `ls -l`: List files _vertically_
- `ls -d`: List _directories_
- `ls -a`: List _all_ (including hidden files)
- `cal`: Calendar
- `date`: Print today's date
- `who`: Who's online?
- `whoami`: Answering life's big questions

---

# Next Steps.

- Assignment #1 is available to you. You should start working on it. 
- To access the assignment, enter this into your terminal: 

`~uli101/a1`

- **Make sure you enter your correct section** or you stand to lose your work.
- Can take ~10 hours to complete the whole thing.
- As you go, your progress will be saved.
- But if you get stuck on a question, you aren't able to skip. So it's a good idea to start work early, and get help once you encounter those issues.
