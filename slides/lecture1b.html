# Introduction to the File System

## History Lesson II

Recall that Linux descended from an operating system designed for mainframes.
That is, a single computer being used by many users simultaneously. In the 1980s,
personal computers (PCs) became available, which as you can imagine was a
revolutionary leap forward! In this case, you had one user working on one
computer. Eventually DOS became the most common operating systems for these PCs,
and Microsoft Windows was built on (and eventually replaced) DOS.

## A Useful Analogy 

+ Windows = a single family home
+ Linux (especially Matrix) = an apartment building

On Matrix, you have a space which is 'yours' for as long as you are a student.
You have control over this space. On the other hand, there is a lot that you
*don't* have control over. The plumbing, the heat, the HVAC, and so on. There is
an administrator/superintendant that has authority over these spaces, and who
has permission to make changes. The super has authority to create, modify and
remove user accounts.

---

## Explore Your "Apartment"

- Use `ls` to view your home folder.
- Use `cd Documents` to change your current location to `Documents`.
- Use `cd ..` to return to your home.
- Use `pwd` to see your current location.

---

## Explore the "Common Space"

The places _outside_ your home folder are common spaces. You can see these
places, but you can't modify them.

- Use `cd /bin` to travel to one such location.
- Type `ls` to view its contents.
- Find `ls` in the contents of this folder. 

_`ls` is a program. And its location is in `/bin`! So what would happen if a
malicious person decided to modify `ls` for everyone?_

## Navigating the Linux Filesystem

You don't know it yet, but we've just demonstrated two different types of
filepaths. To see how this works, let's use a different type of diagram.

![tree diagram](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/uli101/lecture2-tree.jpg)

## Here are Some Rules

The rules for this 'game' are simple.

- Every dot is a _directory_. Moving along any line will take one 'turn.'
- We want to _minimize_ the number of turns we take.
- Every directory has _one parent_. (Except for the very top).
- Directories don't have _unique_ names. So there might be _many_ directories with the name `bin`.
- We need to be able to move from _anywhere_ in the tree to _anywhere else_.
- We need to always be _specific_ when we are describing our moves.
- When choosing our path, we can start from our _current location_, or from the _top_ of the tree.

---

## Moving Into a Subdirectory

- Assume we are moving from point **A** to point **B**. This movement takes one
"turn."
- The command to do this is: `cd B`.

![to subdirectory](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/uli101/lecture2-to-sub.jpg)

---

## Moving Into a Sub-Subdirectory

- Assume we are moving from point **A** to point **B** again. This movement
  takes two turns.
- You could enter the command `cd aa`, and then press enter, and then enter `cd
  B`. But this is a waste of time. Instead, we can enter: `cd aa/B`.
- The **/** here is indicating that there are two turns: moving into directory
  `aa` and then moving into directory `B` from `aa`.

![to subdirectory2](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/uli101/lecture2-to-sub2.jpg)

---

## Moving Into a Parent Directory

- Assume we are moving from point **A** to point **B** again. This movement
  takes one turn.
- Since `A` only has one parent, we can save ourselves some typing by using
  **..**. 
- The command to do this is: `cd ..`.

![to parent](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/uli101/lecture2-to-parent.jpg)

---

## Moving Into a Parent Directory II

- Once again, we are moving from point **A** to point **B**. We are combining
  two turns in one command. 
- The command is: `cd ../..`.

![to parent2](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/uli101/lecture2-to-parent2.jpg)

---

## Lateral Movement

- In this case, **A** and **B** have a common parent. We must move up to the
  directory `aa` before moving to **B**. This movement takes two turns.
- The command is: `cd ../B`.

![lateral movement](https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~eric.brauer/uli101/lecture2-lateral.jpg)

---

## Start From Root (/)

- If we were to move up the tree from **A**, the command would be `cd ../../B`
  and it would take three turns.
- Instead, we should start from the top, which will take only one turn.
- The top is called **root** (**/**).
- To indicate that we are starting from the top instead of starting from **A**,
  we start our command with **/**.
- The correct command is: `cd /B`.

---

## Navigating the Linux Filesystem II

- Now let's replace labels like **A** and **B** with some proper directory
  names. 
- Refer back to the navigation commands you used in Assignment 1. Do they match
  up?

## The Tree Command

Compare the tree diagrams above with the output from `tree`:

```
.
├── sample_dir
│   ├── faculty
│   ├── markham
│   ├── oxford
│   │   ├── programming
│   │   ├── report
│   │   └── security
│   ├── stenton
│   │   ├── gen_ed
│   │   └── lib_arts
│   └── todays-example
└── users
    ├── ebrau
    └── sam

```

- **Challenge: re-draw this in the 'tree' format**
- `.` has two subdirectories (two dots)
- `sample_dir` has **five** subdirectories.

---
## Practice in Matrix

Now, in your home directory, try this:

- use `tree` to see your home directory
- observe the output
- use cd to get to every location
- use `cd` (without any arguments!) to get back to home
- use `cd ..` to get to the *parent* of your home
- type `ls`, what do you see?
- type `tree -d`
- why are most things hidden?

# Terminology

- _parent_
- _subdirectory_
- _home_
- _root_
- _user_ 

---

# Commands

- `pwd`
- `cd`
- `ls`
- `tree`
