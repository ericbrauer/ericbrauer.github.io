OSL740 Summer 2023 Assignment 1 instructions for mahmed267
Install a new Centos 7 VM into your existing c7host, using any of the installation methods covered in this course.
Ensure the machine has the gnome-desktop.
Set the hostname of this machine to be assign1.host.
Provide this VM with 15GiB of storage.
While the default partition setup will be mostly sufficient, make sure your new VM has a separate 1300 MiB /ext4 volume mounted at /media.
  Note: You can free up space to be able to do this, by shrinking the / volume to 10 GiB.
Make sure the nmap-ncat package is present on your machine.
Make sure the libchamplain-gtk package is not present on your machine.
Create new users called shawn smythe, paul browne, and sophie jones.  Their login names should be shawn.smythe, paul.browne, and s.jones respectively.
Create a group called sen_programmers with GID 2000.  Add shawn smythe and sophie jones to it as a supplementary group.
Set the account for sophie jones so that they can use the sudo command to execute the ss command.  Do not use the main sudoers file for this.
Modify the machine so that it will boot to the command-line automatically.
Modify your backupVM.py script from lab2 to backup any VM on your c7host machine, regardless of its name or where the image file is stored.
  Note: The --name option for the virsh list command will prove helpful.  So will the fact that the source file is one of the values stored in each machine's xml definition.
