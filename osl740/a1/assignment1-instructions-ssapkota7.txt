OSL740 Summer 2023 Assignment 1 instructions for ssapkota7
Install a new Centos 7 VM into your existing c7host, using any of the installation methods covered in this course.
Ensure the machine has the gnome-desktop.
Set the hostname of this machine to be assign.machine.
Provide this VM with 15GiB of storage.
While the default partition setup will be mostly sufficient, make sure your new VM has a separate 1900 MiB /ext4 volume mounted at /var/root.
  Note: You can free up space to be able to do this, by shrinking the / volume to 10 GiB.
Make sure the kolourpaint package is present on your machine.
Make sure the libburn package is not present on your machine.
Create new users called marie parker, stephen li, and randal jensen.  Their login names should be marie.parker, stephen.li, and r.jensen respectively.
Create a group called senior_admins with GID 1116.  Add marie parker and randal jensen to it as a supplementary group.
Set the account for stephen li so that they can use the sudo command to execute the yum command.  Do not use the main sudoers file for this.
Modify the machine so that it will boot to the command-line automatically.
Modify your backupVM.py script from lab2 to backup any VM on your c7host machine, regardless of its name or where the image file is stored.
  Note: The --name option for the virsh list command will prove helpful.  So will the fact that the source file is one of the values stored in each machine's xml definition.
