OSL740 Summer 2023 Assignment 1 instructions for jasbir-singh1
Install a new Centos 7 VM into your existing c7host, using any of the installation methods covered in this course.
Ensure the machine has the gnome-desktop.
Set the hostname of this machine to be a.1.
Provide this VM with 15GiB of storage.
While the default partition setup will be mostly sufficient, make sure your new VM has a separate 1200 MiB /ext4 volume mounted at /var/libexeca.
  Note: You can free up space to be able to do this, by shrinking the / volume to 10 GiB.
Make sure the bind-utils package is present on your machine.
Make sure the orca package is not present on your machine.
Create new users called anthony parker, steven li, and randal jenson.  Their login names should be anthony.parker, steven.li, and r.jenson respectively.
Create a group called management with GID 1050.  Add anthony parker and randal jenson to it as a supplementary group.
Set the account for anthony parker so that they can use the sudo command to execute the ip command.  Do not use the main sudoers file for this.
Modify the machine so that it will boot to the command-line automatically.
Modify your backupVM.py script from lab2 to backup any VM on your c7host machine, regardless of its name or where the image file is stored.
  Note: The --name option for the virsh list command will prove helpful.  So will the fact that the source file is one of the values stored in each machine's xml definition.
