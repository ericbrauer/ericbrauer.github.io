<p>Good resource if you want a second perspective on what we discuss in class.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="other-resources">Other Resources</h1>
<ul>
<li>MS Teams is where the live tutorials will occur</li>
<li>Study Group (Very helpful!)</li>
<li>Most important resource is your own <em>practice</em>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="course-policies-remote">Course Policies: Remote</h1>
<ul>
<li>Keep up with the course: watch Blackboard Announcements for upcoming important dates.</li>
<li>Links to the lecture videos will be provided: watch these in order and make note of any questions you might have.</li>
<li>Tutorials are real-time, they are a chance for us to connect as a group. Bring your questions (or email them ahead of time), they make the tutorials more interesting for everyone.</li>
<li>After Tutorials, we have a chance for one-on-one sessions. <del>Some</del> <em>Most</em> problems are easier to solve during these sessions than over email.</li>
<li>Keep up with assignments, these are crucial for success in the course!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attendance</strong>: Some tutorials will have short quizzes/surveys that count for marks. However attendance is not mandatory. <strong>Tutorials will be recorded for people to refer to later.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tests/Quizzes</strong>: I will announce on Blackboard/in class/Email at least a week in advance. (Specifics of how quizzes will run TBA). If you miss an assessment, you get a zero. If you have a doctor’s note, you need to tell me <strong>before</strong> the assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Dishonesty</strong>: Zero tolerance. I expect you to know the difference.</li>
<li>If you have an issue, be prepared to communicate the <strong>specific issue</strong>, including:
<ul>
<li>error output.</li>
<li>what you have tried already.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="course-policies-ii">Course Policies II</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assignments</strong> are a big part of this course.<br />
</li>
<li>You will need to log on to our servers in order to work on these assignments.</li>
<li>The assignments don’t exist locally, you must have an internet connection to access the servers.- But your progress will be saved automatically as we go.</li>
<li><strong>Most importantly, learn by doing.</strong> Practice what you learn in the assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="time-for-a-history-lesson">Time for a History Lesson…</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unix was developed in 1969, and was meant to run on <em>mainframes</em>.</li>
<li>Unix was widely adopted by businesses but also academic institutions.</li>
<li>Many people were comfortable with Unix, but it was <em>proprietary</em>, meaning it wasn’t free to copy, use or modify.</li>
<li>Richard Stallman started the GNU project in 1983, hoping to build a Unix-like operating system.</li>
<li>Linus Torvalds contributed the <em>kernel</em> in 1991. So have that name ‘Linux’, but keep in mind that there were many contributors to the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="because-linux-is-everywhere">Because Linux is <em>everywhere</em>…</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supercomputers</li>
<li>Majority of Servers and Network Infrastructure</li>
<li>Embedded computers (Think: Raspberry Pi, Cars, Kiosks, ATMs, etc.)</li>
<li>Smartphones (until Fuchsia replaces Android!)</li>
<li>Sometimes even on desktops. (~2%!)</li>

<ul>
<li>CLI = Command Line Interface. CLIs are not unique to Linux. Powershell in Windows, Bash on Mac.</li>
<li>Being able to use a CLI is a crucial skill for programmers for a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li>It’s faster</li>
<li>A number of commands can be put into a script and can then be run automatically</li>
<li>Many servers or embedded systems won’t even have a graphical environment installed, or it might be broken. A CLI could be your last resort</li>
<li>Many tools for developers are designed to be used from a CLI (for example, Git and NPM).</li>
<li>CLIs are much easier to set up for remote work</li>
<li>If you’ve ever had to try and help someone solve a problem remotely on their computer, you know how slow and awkward using a GUI can be. (“Click on the Start Button. No, the other Start Button. What do you see?”) Using a GUI is like playing 20 questions. A CLI is all about communicating <em>directly</em> with the system. You need to know the language, but once you do you can get what you want much faster.</li>
<li>CLIs are more fun :D <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/176/251/4d7.png" alt="CLI is just cooler(?)" /></li>

<p>Call it Linux, or GNU/Linux, probably at this point it isn’t too interesting to you. Just be aware that in some corners of the Internet, the terminology is important.</p>

<!--Answer with questions: 

- What is meant by devices?
- Keyboard, OK. How does a keyboard work? More basic, more basic.

- OK, if you really want to know, you can go find out. But really, you press A, you see A. Right?
- Another question: How many programs can your computer run at a time? Open Firefox, calculator, notepad, discord, etc. etc.
- How many cores on your CPU? How many instructions do you think your core can run at a time?
- When you have too many things open at a time, your computer 'slows down.' What does that really mean?
- How fast does a core run? GigaHertz? Do you think that speed (3.8 GHz) is slowing down?
- Finally: memory. In your C class, you're going to talk about pointers, memory addressing, all that kind of stuff. Store a number in memory. Look for it. How does the computer know where to look?-->

<h1 id="kernel-summary">Kernel Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>The Kernel is a thing that acts as an interface between applications and hardware.</em></li>
<li><em>You can’t directly interact with it. It’s not quite the Operating System.</em></li>
<li><em>Maybe a good analogy is an air traffic controller. You don’t see the effect is you’re a passenger at the airport, watching the planes. It doesn’t affect your user experience at all.</em></li>
<li><p><em>Linux has many desktop environments. But they all use the same Kernel.</em> (Windows, by comparison, has only one Desktop environment. It’s running on the Windows NT kernel, but we never really talk about the Windows kernel.)</p></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_operating_system_kernels">Feel free to geek out over the specifics</a></li>

<p><a href="https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/ULI101">See the ULI101 Website</a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>(New for Fall)</strong> Install the <a href="https://inside.senecacollege.ca/its/services/vpn/">Seneca VPN</a></li>
<li>Install a terminal emulator of your choice.</li>
<li>Enter <code>matrix.senecacollege.ca</code> for the host name, and click “Open.”</li>
<li>If you see a dialog box about security, click ‘Yes.’</li>
<li>When you see the text <code>Login as:</code>, enter your myseneca username. For example, <code>ebrauer11</code>. This is the same username you use to log into Blackboard. <strong>(Must be lowercase!)</strong></li>
<li>Enter your Blackboard password.</li>
<li>If all is well, you should see a prompt that looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>[eric.brauer@mtrx-node04pd ~]$</code></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="commands-are-what-we-really-want-you-to-learn">Commands Are What We <em>Really</em> Want You To Learn!</h2>
<p>Once you are in Matrix/Knoppix, you can practice the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pwd</code>: Print working directory</li>
<li><code>cd</code>: Change directory</li>
<li><code>ls</code>: List files</li>
<li><code>ls -l</code>: List files <em>vertically</em></li>
<li><code>ls -d</code>: List <em>directories</em></li>
<li><code>ls -a</code>: List <em>all</em> (including hidden files)</li>
<li><code>cal</code>: Calendar</li>

<h1 id="next-steps.">Next Steps.</h1>
<ul>
<li>Assignment #1 is available to you. You should start working on it.</li>
<li>To access the assignment, enter this into your terminal:</li>
</ul>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>Login to: <code>matrix.senecacollege.ca</code> using your username and password.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>~uli101/assign1</code> at the command prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter your <strong>correct</strong> section.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure you enter your correct section</strong> or you stand to lose your work.</li>
<li>Can take ~10 hours to complete the whole thing.</li>
<li>As you go, your progress will be saved.</li>
<li>But if you get stuck on a question, you aren’t able to skip. So it’s a good idea to start work early, and get help once you encounter those issues.</li>
